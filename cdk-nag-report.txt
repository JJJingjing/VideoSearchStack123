[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoSearchVPC/Resource] AwsSolutions-VPC7: The VPC does not have an associated Flow Log. VPC Flow Logs capture network flow information for a VPC, subnet, or network interface and stores it in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Flow log data can help customers troubleshoot network issues; for example, to diagnose why specific traffic is not reaching an instance, which might be a result of overly restrictive security group rules.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/UnifiedBucket/Resource] AwsSolutions-S1: The S3 Bucket has server access logs disabled. The bucket should have server access logging enabled to provide detailed records for the requests that are made to the bucket.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/UnifiedBucket/Resource] AwsSolutions-S10: The S3 Bucket or bucket policy does not require requests to use SSL. You can use HTTPS (TLS) to help prevent potential attackers from eavesdropping on or manipulating network traffic using person-in-the-middle or similar attacks. You should allow only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS) using the aws:SecureTransport condition on Amazon S3 bucket policies.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/UnifiedBucket/Policy/Resource] AwsSolutions-S10: The S3 Bucket or bucket policy does not require requests to use SSL. You can use HTTPS (TLS) to help prevent potential attackers from eavesdropping on or manipulating network traffic using person-in-the-middle or similar attacks. You should allow only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS) using the aws:SecureTransport condition on Amazon S3 bucket policies.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoSearchApi/Resource] AwsSolutions-APIG2: The REST API does not have request validation enabled. The API should have basic request validation enabled. If the API is integrated with custom source (Lambda, ECS, etc..) in the backend, deeper input validation should be considered for implementation.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoSearchApi/DeploymentStage.prod/Resource] AwsSolutions-APIG1: The API does not have access logging enabled. Enabling access logs helps operators view who accessed an API and how the caller accessed the API.

[Warning at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoSearchApi/DeploymentStage.prod/Resource] AwsSolutions-APIG3: The REST API stage is not associated with AWS WAFv2 web ACL. AWS WAFv2 is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications and APIs from attacks by allowing configured rules to allow, block, or monitor (count) web requests based on customizable rules and conditions that are defined.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoSearchApi/Default/search/POST/Resource] AwsSolutions-APIG4: The API does not implement authorization. In most cases an API needs to have an authentication and authorization implementation strategy. This includes using such approaches as IAM, Cognito User Pools, Custom authorizer, etc.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoSearchApi/Default/search/POST/Resource] AwsSolutions-COG4: The API GW method does not use a Cognito user pool authorizer. API Gateway validates the tokens from a successful user pool authentication, and uses them to grant your users access to resources including Lambda functions, or your own API.

[Warning at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/FrontendDistribution/Resource] AwsSolutions-CFR1: The CloudFront distribution may require Geo restrictions. Geo restriction may need to be enabled for the distribution in order to allow or deny a country in order to allow or restrict users in specific locations from accessing content.

[Warning at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/FrontendDistribution/Resource] AwsSolutions-CFR2: The CloudFront distribution may require integration with AWS WAF. The Web Application Firewall can help protect against application-layer attacks that can compromise the security of the system or place unnecessary load on them.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/FrontendDistribution/Resource] AwsSolutions-CFR3: The CloudFront distribution does not have access logging enabled. Enabling access logs helps operators track all viewer requests for the content delivered through the Content Delivery Network.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/FrontendDistribution/Resource] AwsSolutions-CFR4: The CloudFront distribution allows for SSLv3 or TLSv1 for HTTPS viewer connections. Vulnerabilities have been and continue to be discovered in the deprecated SSL and TLS protocols. Help protect viewer connections by specifying a viewer certificate that enforces a minimum of TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 in the security policy. Distributions that use the default CloudFront viewer certificate or use 'vip' for the 'SslSupportMethod' are non-compliant with this rule, as the minimum security policy is set to TLSv1 regardless of the specified 'MinimumProtocolVersion'.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/FrontendDistribution/Resource] AwsSolutions-CFR7: The CloudFront distribution does not use an origin access control with an S3 origin. Origin access controls help with security by restricting any direct access to objects through S3 URLs.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoDataCluster/Resource] AwsSolutions-DOC2: The Document DB cluster uses the default endpoint port. Port obfuscation (using a non default endpoint port) adds an additional layer of defense against non-targeted attacks (i.e. MongoDB port 27017).

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoDataCluster/Resource] AwsSolutions-DOC3: The Document DB cluster does not have the username and password stored in Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager enables operators to replace hardcoded credentials in your code, including passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. This helps ensure the secret can't be compromised by someone examining system code, because the secret no longer exists in the code. Also, operators can configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secret for you according to a specified schedule. This enables you to replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, significantly reducing the risk of compromise.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoDataCluster/Resource] AwsSolutions-DOC4: The Document DB cluster does not have a reasonable minimum backup retention period configured. The retention period represents the number of days to retain automated snapshots. A minimum retention period of 7 days is recommended but can be adjust to meet system requirements.

[Error at /VideoSearchStack-uswest2/VideoDataCluster/Resource] AwsSolutions-DOC5[LogExport::authenticate]: The Document DB cluster does not have authenticate, createIndex, and dropCollection Log Exports enabled. This allows operators to use CloudWatch to view logs to help diagnose problems in the database. The events recorded by the AWS DocumentDB audit logs include successful and failed authentication attempts, creating indexes or dropping a collection in a database within the DocumentDB cluster.This is a granular rule that returns individual findings that can be suppressed with 'appliesTo'. The findings are in the format 'LogExport::<log>' for exported logs. Example: appliesTo: ['LogExport::authenticate'].
